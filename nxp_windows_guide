To generate driver packages on a development machine, install test certificates.
1. Open an Administrator Command Prompt.
2. Navigate to your BSP, the folder imx-windows-iot\build\tools.
3. Launch StartBuildEnv.bat.
4. Run SetupCertificate.bat to install the test certificates.
5. The HAL Extensions must be signed by certificates provided by Microsoft. The required certificates that are
included in WDK have expired. Download the Windows 11, version 22H2 EWDK and use the “Windows
OEM HAL Extension Test Cert 2017 \(TEST ONLY\)” and “Windows OEM Intermediate 2017 \(TEST ONLY
\)” found in the EWDK.iso file or contact Microsoft for help.
Some tools may not work correctly if LongPath is not enabled, therefore run the following command in the
Execute command: 
reg add HKEY_LOCAL_MACHINE\SYSTEM\CurrentControlSet\Control\FileSystem /v LongPathsEnabled /t REG_DWORD /d 1
